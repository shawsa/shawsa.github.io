I am an applied mathematician turned data scientist with a strong background in
mathematics and software development.

I've spent the last eight years pursuing a career as an academic mathematician
and am looking to begin my career as a data scientist. Why the change? I have
always been strongly motivated by my ethics, and I believe that I can do more
good for more people by working outside of the academy.

As a mathematician, I am an expert in recognizing and understanding patterns and
I have the knowledge and skill to do so effectively. Furthermore, my eight years
of teaching experience enables me to convey my understanding to others
empowering us as a team. For example, it is useful to be able to recognize
Simpson's Paradox in a data set and to avoid concluding an erroneous correlation.
It is even more useful to also teach a team that correlation of subsets does not
always imply correlation of the whole, and to demonstrate this with a minimal
data set and scatter plot. For another example, when designing a class in
software it is useful to recognize when the monoid pattern is advantageous.
It is even more useful to be able to demonstrate this advantage by showing an
example of method chaining in Pandas and how it makes code more readable and
more flexible. Catch someone a fish and you’ll feed them for a day.
Teachsomeone to fish... you know the adage. We can achieve more together than
we can individually, and sharing knowledge is essential.

I have a passion for computer programming, both as a vocation and as a hobby,
and I love to learn. In particular, for the last 70+ years, computer scientists
have been trying to answer the question “how should we structure our code” and
I have learned from their mistakes and their triumphs. I understand how and when
to use the Object Oriented and Functional paradigms. I am an advocate of the
SOLID principles (except Liskov substitution). I use state-of-the-art development
tools: Git, GitHub, uv, IPython, etc. In short, I write good code that is correct,
flexible, robust, and practical.

I love to do math, I love to code, and I love to teach. It’s important to me
that my work has an impact on the world and improves the lives of people.
