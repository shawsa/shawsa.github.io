# My package [odeiter](https://shawsa.github.io/odeiter) now has documentation

`odeiter` is a python package for solving systems of differential equations using
generators. Generators decouple the iteration from the looping body.
This allows you to loop over the solution directly, and separates the
solve code (handled by `odeiter`) from the code you write to do something
productive with the solution.

  solves using different time-integrators.
