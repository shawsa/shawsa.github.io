Mathematician turned data scientist. 

# Open to work!

I want to do meaningful collaborative work that has a positive impact and leverages my
background in mathematics and scientific computing. I love to code, I love to learn, and I
love to teach. Itâ€™s important to me to continuously improve and to take the time to help others
improve too.

If you're interested in hiring me, send me an email!

# [odeiter](https://shawsa.github.io/odeiter) now has documentation

`odeiter` is a python package for solving systems of differential equations using
generators. Generators decouple the iteration from the looping body.
This allows you to loop over the solution directly, and separtes the
solve code (handled by `odeiter`) from the code you write to do something
productive with the solution.
