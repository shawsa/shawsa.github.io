### Radial Basis Function Techniques for Neural Field Models on Surfaces
[ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13379) (2025) (submitted to SISC)

We present a numerical framework for solving neural field equations on surfaces
using Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation and quadrature. Neural field
models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling studies
often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains. Traditional
numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can be
computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains.
In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering
interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary
geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory
projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for
both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy
and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting
polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate
the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional
approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition
of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces,
illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns.

## Representing stimulus motion with waves in adaptive neural fields
[Journal of Computational Neuroscience](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-024-00869-z)(2024)

Traveling waves of neural activity emerge in cortical networks both spontaneously
and in response to stimuli. The spatiotemporal structure of waves can indicate
the information they encode and the physiological processes that sustain them.
Here, we investigate the stimulus-response relationships of traveling waves
emerging in adaptive neural fields as a model of visual motion processing.
Neural field equations model the activity of cortical tissue as a continuum
excitable medium, and adaptive processes provide negative feedback, generating
localized activity patterns. Synaptic connectivity in our model is described by
an integral kernel that weakens dynamically due to activity-dependent synaptic
depression, leading to marginally stable traveling fronts (with attenuated backs)
or pulses of a fixed speed. Our analysis quantifies how weak stimuli shift the
relative position of these waves over time, characterized by a wave response
function we obtain perturbatively. Persistent and continuously visible stimuli
model moving visual objects. Intermittent flashes that hop across visual space
can produce the experience of smooth apparent visual motion. Entrainment of
waves to both kinds of moving stimuli are well characterized by our theory and
numerical simulations, providing a mechanistic description of the perception of
visual motion.

### Radial Basis Function Finite Difference Approximations of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator
[MS Thesis(2019)](https://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/td/1587/)

Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used throughout science and engineering
for modeling various phenomena. Solutions to PDEs cannot generally be represented
analytically, and therefore must be approximated using numerical techniques; this
is especially true for geometrically complex domains. Radial basis function
generated finite differences (RBF-FD) is a recently developed mesh-free method
for numerically solving PDEs that is robust, accurate, computationally efficient,
and geometrically flexible. In the past seven years, RBF-FD methods have been
developed for solving PDEs on surfaces, which have applications in biology,
chemistry, geophysics, and computer graphics. These methods are advantageous,
as they are mesh-free, operate on arbitrary configurations of points, and do not
introduce artificial singularities, as surface parameterizations are known to do.
In this thesis, we develop a new RBF-FD method that uses projections on the
tangent plane to approximate the Laplace-Beltrami operator (surface Laplacian).
We then compare this method to two other previously developed RBF-FD methods:
the Projected Gradient method and the Hermite RBF-FD method, on a set of benchmark
problems posed on the sphere and torus. We also provide guidelines for choosing
the various parameters involved in the methods.
