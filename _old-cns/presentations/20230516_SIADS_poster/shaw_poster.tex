	 \textbf{Scientific Question:} \textbf{How do brains encode and predict motion?}
	 \begin{itemize}
		 \item The firing-rate of populations of neurons is sufficient to explain dynamics of large-scale neural networks.
		 \item We can approximate large discrete networks using integro-differential equations called \textit{neural field models}.
		 \item Synaptic depression allows for biologically realistic traveling pulses in neural field models.
		 \item External stimuli can adjust the position of traveling pulses.

\headerbox{Background: Synaptic Depression}{name=background, column=0, below=summary}
{
	\begin{itemize}
	\item When a pre-synaptic neuron fires, it releases neurotransimiters into the synaptic cleft separating it from the post-synaptic neuron.
	\item When neurons fire repeatedly, they will deplete their store of neurotransmiters faster than they replenish them.
	\item This results in reduced stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron and a reduced firing-rate. We call this \textbf{synaptic depression}.

			q(\xi, t) &= Q(\xi - \varepsilon \nu(t)) + \varepsilon \psi(\xi -\varepsilon \nu(t), t) + \OO(\varepsilon^2)

		\begin{align*}
   		\begin{bmatrix}\tau_u & 0 \\ 0 & \tau_q\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\phi \\ \psi \end{bmatrix}_t + \LL \left(\begin{bmatrix} \phi \\ \psi \end{bmatrix} \right)

  \beta Q f'(U) & \beta f(U)
		\end{bmatrix}
		\begin{bmatrix}\phi \\ \psi \end{bmatrix}
		\end{align*}
		\item We have bounded solutions if the right-hand-side is orthogonal to the null-space of the adjoint.
		\item The one-dimensional null-space $(v_1, v_2) \in \mathcal{N}(\LL^*)$ satisfies
		\begin{align*}
	    	-c \tau_u v_1' &= v_1 -f'(U)Q \int_\RR w(|y-\xi|) v_1(y) \ dy + \beta Q f'(U)v_2 \\

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Localized moving stimuli can accelerate traveling pulses to match their speed. The pulse is said to \textbf{entrain} to the stimulus.
		\item Consider a moving square stimulus with height $\varepsilon$, width $y^*$, and speed $c + \Delta_c$
		$$
			I_u(\xi, t) = H\big(-(\xi -\Delta_c t\big)) - H\big(-(\xi + y^* - \Delta_c t\big)), \quad I_q = 0
		$$
		\begin{center}
					\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth, trim={0cm, .2cm, 0cm, .2cm}, clip=true]{entrainment_square_profile}
				\end{center}
		\item If the stimulus is too weak or to fast then the wave response will be finite and the wave will not entrain to the stimulus.
		
		\item We use the ansatz $\varepsilon \nu(t) = y(t) + \Delta_c t$. The wave can entrain only if the steady state solution $\bar{y}$ is stable.
		\item This gives the necessary first order condition
		$$
			\Delta_c < \frac{\varepsilon c \tau_u}{\tau_u \langle v_1, U' \rangle + \tau_q \langle v_2, Q' \rangle}
		$$
