# [odeiter](https://shawsa.github.io/odeiter)

A python package for solving systems of differential equations using
generators. Generators decouple the iteration from the looping body.
This allows you to loop over the solution directly, and separtes the
solve code (handled by `odeiter`) from the code you write to do something
productive with the solution.

# [Neural Fields RBF](https://github.com/shawsa/neural-fields-rbf)

A framework for solving neural field equations on realistic cortical surfaces.
This is the implementation for the paper [Radial Basis Function Techniques
for Neural Field Models on Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13379).
