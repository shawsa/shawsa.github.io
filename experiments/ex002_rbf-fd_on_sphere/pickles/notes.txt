sphere_harm_1.pickle
r^3 augmented with spherical harmonics up to degree 3 with stencil size 31.
Shows good convergence for degrees 1 and up. NOTE: the spherical harmonics
were not scaled or centered in the stencil.

sphere_harm_1.pickle
r^3 augmented with spherical harmonics up to degree 6 with stencil size 101.
Shows good convergence for degrees 1 through 3 and up. Degrees 4 through 6
become bad after 6400 total nodes are used. NOTE: the spherical harmonics
were not scaled or centered in the stencil.

sphere_harm_survey_0.pickle
rbf_labels = ['r^6*log(r)', 'r^7', 'r^8*log(r)', 'r^9']
basis_degs = range(4)
Augmented with spherical harmonics. The spherical harmonic terms were centered
to the stencil center but they were not scaled.
Shows good convergence for sufficient degree and improving convergence for 
higher degree RBF until degree 3 at which point they are the same. This 
may be due to using a second degree spherical harmonic as the test function.

PHS_better_than_gaussian_0.pickle
rbf_labels = ['r^3', 'r^5', 'r^9', 'gaussian']
basis_degs = [4]
gaussian ns = [200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400] singular for larger values
PHS ns = [12800, 25600]
Shows that PHS rbfs with high enough basis terms get higher accuracy than 
the gaussian.
