abstract = {A new analytical method of representing irregular surfaces that involves the summation of equations of quadric surfaces having unknown coefficients is described. The quadric surfaces are located at significant points throughout the region to be mapped. Procedures are given for solving multiquadric equations of topography that are based on coordinate data. Contoured multiquadric surfaces are compared with topography and other irregular surfaces from which the multiquadric equation was derived.}
