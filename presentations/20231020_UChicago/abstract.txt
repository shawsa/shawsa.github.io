We examine traveling wave solutions of a neural field model (integro-differential system) incorporating synaptic depression, allowing for biologically realistic traveling pulse solutions similar to those observed experimentally. We use these pulses as a biologically plausible model for visual motion processing, and develop an asymptotic wave response function characterizing how traveling pulse solutions respond to perturbative stimuli. For some spatially localized moving stimuli, traveling pulse solutions can accelerate to match the speed and location of the stimulus - a phenomenon known as entrainment. Generally speaking, traveling pulse solutions will entrain to spatially localized moving stimuli if the stimuli are sufficiently weak and sufficiently slow. We use our wave response function to identify this speed-magnitude threshold to first order. Finally, we apply our wave response function to a stimulus meant to evoke the apparent motion illusion - a phenomenon where a sequence of stationary stimuli are presented and motion is perceived.
