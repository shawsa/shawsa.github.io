* Thanks and achknowlegements
    * Sam, Dan, and the department (only if they give pizza)
    * References first?
* Dijkstra's GOTO paper
    * Start with a C example that's hard because of GOTO
    * Talk about Dijkstra's paper
    * Show a loop example that's hard because of mutation
    * 'Structure and Function of Computer Programs' quote assignment apology?
* Functional programming overview
    * no mutation
    * pure functions and side-effects
    * compose functions ?
    * state and closures?
* Generators
    * motivate with procedural example that must be changed many times
    * define generator with examples
    * create generators from generators (generator expressions / comprehensions)
    * pipelines
    * reuse parts
* Impressive example (NN?)
* Markov Example
    * trivial parellelezation ?
